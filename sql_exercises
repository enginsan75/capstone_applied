##Generally, you should try to avoid using column or table names containing spaces or using reserved words in SQL. 
##For example, it's best to avoid names like "table" or "first name".
##If you must use such names, put them between back-tick `` delimiters. 
##For example:
CREATE TABLE `table` (
`first name` VARCHAR(30) );

SELECT `first name` FROM `table` WHERE `first name` LIKE 'a%';

#Data Types:
 
CHAR(n) is a string of a fixed length of n characters. If it is CHARACTER SET utf8mb4, 
that means it occupies exactly 4*n bytes, regardless of what text is in it.
Most use cases for CHAR(n) involve strings that contain English characters, hence should be CHARACTER SET ascii. 
(latin1 will do just as good.)

country_code CHAR(2) CHARACTER SET ascii,
postal_code CHAR(6) CHARACTER SET ascii,
uuid CHAR(39) CHARACTER SET ascii


city VARCHAR(100) -- This Russian town needs 91:
Poselok Uchebnogo Khozyaystva Srednego Professionalno-Tekhnicheskoye Uchilishche Nomer Odin
country VARCHAR(50) -- probably enough
name VARCHAR(64) -- probably adequate; more than some government agencies allow

Why not simply 255? There are two reasons to avoid the common practice of using (255) for everything.
When a complex SELECT needs to create temporary table (for a subquery, UNION, GROUP BY, etc), the preferred choice is to use 
the MEMORY engine, 
which puts the data in RAM. But VARCHARs are turned into CHAR in the process. This makes VARCHAR(255) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 
take 1020 bytes. That can lead to needing to spill to disk, which is slower.
In certain situations, InnoDB will look at the potential size of the columns in a table and decide that it will be 
too big, aborting a CREATE TABLE.

VARCHAR versus TEXT:

Usage hints for *TEXT, CHAR, and VARCHAR, plus some Best Practice:
Never use TINYTEXT.
Almost never use CHAR -- it is fixed length; each character is the max length of the CHARACTER bytes/character for utf8mb4).
With CHAR, use CHARACTER SET ascii unless you know otherwise.
VARCHAR(n) will truncate at n characters; TEXT will truncate at some number of bytes. (But, do you want truncation?)
TEXT may slow down complex SELECTs due to how temp tables are handled.


Implicit / automatic casting:

select '123' * 2;
#mupltiply string '123' with 2 gives an numneric, automatically convert string to numeric

select '123ABC' * 2
#it gives 246

select 'ABC12' * 2

Integer Types: INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT
Fixed Point Types DECIMAL, NUMERIC
Floating Point Types FLOAT, DOUBLE
Bit Value Type BIT

SELECT CompanyName FROM Customers 
WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID BETWEEN 'ALFKI' and 'BLAUS');



SELECT CompanyName FROM Customers 
WHERE CustomerID = (SELECT CustomerID FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID LIKE 'ALF%');

#USING VARIABLES:

#Sometimes, you want to pass a value from an SQL statement to another SQL statement. 
#To do this, you store the value in a MySQL user-defined variable in the first statement and 
#refer to it in the subsequent statements.

#To create a user-defined variable, you use the format @variable_name, where the variable_name consists 
#of alphanumeric characters. The maximum length of the user-defined variable is 64 characters as of MySQL 5.7.5

#The user-defined variables are not case-sensitive. It means that the @id and @ID are the same.

#You can assign the user-defined variable to a certain data types such as integer, floating point, decimal, 
#string or NULL.

#A user-defined variable defined by one client is not visible by other clients. In other words, an user-defined 
#variable is session-specific.

#Note that the user-defined variables are the MySQL-specific extension to SQL standard. 
#They may not be available in other database systems.


#MySQL variable assignment:
There are two ways to assign a value to a user-defined variable.

The first way is to use the SET statement as follows:

SET @counter := 100;

The second way is to use SELECT statement :

SElECT @counter := 100;


#EXAMPLES:
SELECT 
    @max_price:=MAX(UnitPrice)
FROM
    Products;


The following statement uses the @max_price variable to query the information of the most expensive product.

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    Products
WHERE
    UnitPrice  = @max_price;


#A user-defined variable can hold a single value only. If the SELECT statement returns multiple values, 
#the variable will take the value of the last row in the result.

SELECT 
    @unit_order:= UnitsOnOrder
FROM
    Products
WHERE
    UnitsOnOrder >30
ORDER BY  UnitsOnOrder;

#the last row was 100, so check it:

SELECT @unit_order;




#ROW NUMBER and GROUP BY using variables in Select Statement:

SET @row_no := 0;
SELECT @row_no := @row_no + 1 AS 'row_number', UnitPrice, ProductName FROM Products;



    SELECT ProductName,                                                                                                                            
      @price_sum:=UnitPrice AS price_total                                                                                                                   
      FROM Products                                                                                                                                   
      GROUP BY ProductName, price_total;

/*DELETE vs TRUNCATE

TRUNCATE tableName;

This will delete all the data and reset AUTO_INCREMENT index. It's much faster than DELETE FROM tableName on a
huge dataset. It can be very useful during development/testing.
When you truncate a table SQL server doesn't delete the data, it drops the table and recreates it, 
thereby deallocating the pages 
so there is a chance to recover the truncated data before the pages where overwritten. 
(The space cannot immediately be recouped for innodb_file_per_table=OFF.)*/

#Multiple Table UPDATE:
/*
For example consider two tables, products and salesOrders. In case, we decrease the quantity of 
a particular product from the sales order which is placed already. Then we also need to increase that 
quantity in our stock column of products table. This can be done in single SQL update statement like below.


UPDATE products, salesOrders
SET salesOrders.Quantity = salesOrders.Quantity - 5,
products.availableStock = products.availableStock + 5 WHERE products.productId = salesOrders.productId
AND salesOrders.orderId = 100 AND salesOrders.productId = 20;

In the above example, quantity '5' will be reduced from the salesOrders table and the same will be increased 
in products table according to the WHERE conditions.*/
