In this repository you will find some code samples written in python-files with ipyn extensions (SpaceX project, data science application, IBM) and my dashboard sample written by using R, R Shiny, html, python (data collection and wrangling), SQL and deployed to web. In the file "R Shiny Dashboard", there is a web link of the dash and login information to enter the dash. If you have difficulty to use it, you can watch the video. 
Please contact me if you are interested in the codes for the dashboard.
